I re-did the tps report to make it a little easier to complete. 

To change/add the date, title, or project name:
	 Insert->Headers and Footers...

To select who completed task:
	Highlight initial-> Ctrl+B, Ctrl+U

To select percent complete:
	Highlight percent completed-> Ctrl+B, Ctrl+U

To add more rows:
	Create another report from blank and change the footer to page++ (This is for printing purposes)

For printing:
	File->Export as PDF...
